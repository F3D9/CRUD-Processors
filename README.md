# CRUD-Processors

## A simple project on processor models. 

It is a terminal application on a simple CRUD with the functions Create, Read, Update and Delete. 

You create an object (the processors) and you can do any function that is in the application. 

I used only the sqlite3 library for the database that appears in the program.
